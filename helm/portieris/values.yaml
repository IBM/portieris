# Allow an annotation to be used to skip the webhook. This is required for Portieris to be able to
# self heal when it has no running pods, which could otherwise deadlock your cluster after an
# outage.
# However, if this is enabled, anyone with access to annotate namespaces could bypass Portieris by
# setting the annotation on their namespaces. Therefore, be careful with your RBAC policies if you
# enable this option!
