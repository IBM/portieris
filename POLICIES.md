# Portieris policies

## Image policy resources

Portieris defines two custom resource types for policy. Image policy resources and cluster image policy resources.

For both types of resource, if multiple resources exist, they are merged together and can be protected by a role-based access control (RBAC) policy.

* Image policy resources, `ImagePolicy`, are configured in a Kubernetes namespace and define Portieris' behavior in that namespace. If image policy resources exist in a namespace, the policies from those image policy resources are used exclusively. If a match doesn't exist for the workload image in `ImagePolicy`, cluster image policy resources, `ClusterImagePolicy`, are not examined. Images in deployed workloads are wildcard matched against the set of policies defined, if a policy doesn't match the workload image, deployment is denied.

  The following example allows any image from the `icr.io` registry with no further checks (the policy is empty).
 
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: portieris.cloud.ibm.com/v1
  kind: ImagePolicy
  metadata:
    name: allow-all-icrio
  spec:
     repositories:
      - name: "icr.io/*"
        policy:
  ```

* Cluster image policy resources, `ClusterImagePolicy`, are configured at the cluster level, and take effect whenever an image policy resource, `ImagePolicy`, is not defined in the namespace where the workload is deployed. These cluster image policy resources have the same structure as namespace image policy resources and, if a matching policy is not found for an image, deployment is denied.

  The following example allows all images from all registries with no checks.

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: portieris.cloud.ibm.com/v1
  kind: ClusterImagePolicy
  metadata:
    name: portieris-default-cluster-image-policy
  spec:
    repositories:
    - name: '*'
      policy:
  ```

## Installation default policies

Default policies are installed when Portieris is installed. You must review and change these according to your requirements.
You must customize the installation [default policies](helm/portieris/templates/policies.yaml).

## Repository matching

When an image is evaluated for admission, the set of policies is wildcard matched on the repository name. If multiple matches are found, the most specific match is used.

## Policy

A policy consists of an array of objects that define requirements on the image by using either `trust:` (Docker Content Trust and Notary v1), `simple:` (Red Hat Simple Signing), or `vulnerability:` objects.

**Important** If your policy was developed before Portieris v0.10.0, the policy has the API version: 
`apiVersion: securityenforcement.admission.cloud.ibm.com/v1beta1`
To ensure that the policy is enforced, you must update the API version to: 
`apiVersion: portieris.cloud.ibm.com/v1`

### Image mutation option

You can also set a mutate image, `mutateImage: bool`, behavior preference for each policy. The default value is `true`, which is also the original behavior and means that, on successful admission, the container's image property is mutated to ensure that the immutable digest form of the image is used. If the value is `false`, the original image reference is retained with the consequences that are described in the [readme file](README.md#image-mutation-option).

**Example**

```yaml
apiVersion: portieris.cloud.ibm.com/v1
kind: ImagePolicy
metadata:
  name: signedby-me
spec:
   repositories:
    - name: "icr.io/*"
      policy:
        mutateImage: false
        simple:
          requirements:
          - type: "signedBy"
            keySecret: my-pubkey
```

### `trust` (Docker Content Trust and Notary)

Portieris supports sourcing trust data from the following registries without additional configuration in the image policy:

* IBM Cloud&reg; Container Registry
* Quay.io
* Docker Hub

To use a different trust server for a repository, you can specify the `trustServer` parameter in your policy:

**Example**

```yaml
apiVersion: portieris.cloud.ibm.com/v1
kind: ImagePolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-custom
spec:
   repositories:
    - name: "icr.io/*"
      policy:
        trust:
          enabled: true
          trustServer: "https://icr.io:4443" # Optional, custom trust server for repository
```

For more information, see [Customizing policies](#customizing-policies).

#### Specifying trusted content signers in custom policies

If you use content trust, you can verify that images are signed by particular signers. Deployment is allowed only if the most recent signed version is signed by all the listed signers. To add a signer to a repository, see [Managing trusted signers](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_trustedcontent#trustedcontent_signers).

To configure the policy to verify that an image is signed by a particular signer:

1. Get the signer name (the name that was used in `docker trust signer add`), and the signer's public key.
2. Generate a Kubernetes secret with the signer name and their public key.

   ```
   kubectl create secret generic <secret_name> --from-literal=name=<signer_name> --from-file=publicKey=<key.pub>
   ```

3. Add the secret to the `signerSecrets` list for the repository in your policy.

   ```yaml
   - name: example
     policy:
       trust:
         enabled: true
         signerSecrets:
         - name: <secret_name>
   ```
   
### `simple` (Red Hat simple signing)

The policy requirements are similar to those requirements defined for the configuration files that are consulted when you're using the Red Hat&reg; tools [policy requirements](https://github.com/containers/image/blob/master/docs/containers-policy.json.5.md#policy-requirements). However, the main difference is that the public key in a `signedBy` requirement is defined in a `keySecret` attribute, the value is the name of an in-scope Kubernetes secret that contains a public key block. The value of `keyType`, `keyPath`, and `keyData`, see [policy requirements](https://github.com/containers/image/blob/master/docs/containers-policy.json.5.md#policy-requirements), can't be provided. If multiple keys are present in the key ring, the requirement is satisfied if the signature is signed by any one of them.

To export one, or more, public keys that are identified by `<finger-print>`, to a key ring, from GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) and create a KeySecret from it, you can use the following script.

```bash
gpg --export --armour <finger-print> [<finger-print>] > my.pubkey
kubectl create secret generic my-pubkey --from-file=key=my.pubkey
```

When you create the secret, ensure that you're creating the key with a value of `key`.

```
kubectl create secret generic my-pubkey --from-file=key=<your_pub_key_file>
```

The following example requires that images from `icr.io` are signed by the identity with its public key in `my-pubkey`. If multiple public keys are present in `my-pubkey`, the image is required to be signed by any one of them. 

```yaml
apiVersion: portieris.cloud.ibm.com/v1
kind: ImagePolicy
metadata:
  name: signedby-me
spec:
   repositories:
    - name: "icr.io/*"
      policy:
        simple:
          requirements:
          - type: "signedBy"
            keySecret: my-pubkey
```

The following example requires that images from `icr.io` are signed by the identity with public key in `my-pubkey` and the identity with public key in `your-pubkey`.

```yaml
apiVersion: portieris.cloud.ibm.com/v1
kind: ImagePolicy
metadata:
  name: signedby-me
spec:
   repositories:
    - name: "icr.io/*"
      policy:
        simple:
          requirements:
          - type: "signedBy"
            keySecret: my-pubkey
          - type: "signedBy"
            keySecret: your-pubkey
```

The following example requires that a specific image is signed, but it allows the registry location to change. In this pattern, a policy for each image is required to exactly define the new location.

```yaml
apiVersion: portieris.cloud.ibm.com/v1
kind: ImagePolicy
metadata:
  name: db2mirror
spec:
   repositories:
    - name: "uk.icr.io/mymirror/db2/db2manager:6.1.0.0"
      policy:
        simple:
          requirements:
          - type: "signedBy"
            keySecret: db2-pubkey
            signedIdentity:
                type: "matchExactRepository"
                dockerRepository: "icr.io/ibm/db2/db2manager"
```

The following example allows many images with a common origin that moved with their original signature, for example, by mirroring, in this case from `icr.io/db2` to `registry.myco.com:5000/mymirror/ibmdb2`.

```yaml
apiVersion: portieris.cloud.ibm.com/v1
kind: ImagePolicy
metadata:
  name: remapDB2Example
spec:
   repositories:
    - name: "registry.myco.com:5000/mymirror/ibmdb2"
      policy:
        simple:
          requirements:
          - type: "signedBy"
            keySecret: db2-pubkey
            signedIdentity:
                type: "remapIdentity"
                prefix: "registry.myco.com:5000/mymirror/ibmdb2"
                signedPrefix: "icr.io/db2"
```

You can also specify the location of signature storage for registries that don't support the registry extension. Where `storeSecret` identifies an in-scope Kubernetes secret that contains `username` and `password` data items that are used to authenticate with the server referenced in `storeURL`.

```yaml
apiVersion: portieris.cloud.ibm.com/v1
kind: ImagePolicy
metadata:
  name: db2mirror
spec:
   repositories:
    - name: "uk.icr.io/mymirror/db2/db2manager:6.1.0.0"
      policy:
        simple:
          storeURL: https://server.another.com/signatures
          storeSecret: another-secret
          requirements:
          - type: "signedBy"
            keySecret: db2-pubkey
```

### `vulnerability`

Vulnerability policies enable you to admit or deny pod admission based on the security status of the container images within the pod. Vulnerability-based admission is available for [Vulnerability Advisor for IBM Cloud Container Registry](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=va-va_index). Vulnerability Advisor is available for any image in [IBM Cloud Container Registry](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/container-registry).

Example policy:

```yaml
apiVersion: portieris.cloud.ibm.com/v1
kind: ImagePolicy
metadata:
  name: block-vulnerable-images
spec:
   repositories:
    - name: "uk.icr.io/*"
      policy:
        vulnerability:
          ICCRVA:
            enabled: true
            account: "an-IBM-Cloud-account-id"
```

#### Vulnerability Advisor for IBM Cloud Container Registry details

For each `container` in the pod that is being considered for admission, a [vulnerability status](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/container-registry/va#imagestatusquerypath) report is retrieved for the `image` that is specified by the container.

The optional `account` parameter specifies the IBM Cloud&reg; account from where exemptions are retrieved for images that match the policy repository name.

If the report returns an overall status of `OK`, `WARN`, or `UNSUPPORTED` the pod is allowed. In the event of any other status, or any error condition, the pod is denied.

**Note** Recently pushed images to the registry that have not completed scanning are denied admission.

## Customizing policies

You can change the policy that Portieris uses to permit images, either at the cluster or Kubernetes namespace level. In the policy, you can specify different enforcement rules for different images.

**Tip** You must have a policy set. Otherwise, deployments to your cluster fail. If you don't want to enforce any image security policies, [Uninstall Portieris](https://github.com/IBM/portieris#uninstalling-portieris).

When you apply a deployment, Portieris checks whether the Kubernetes namespace that you are deploying to has a policy to apply. If it does not, Portieris uses the cluster-wide policy. Your deployment is denied if no namespace or cluster-wide policy exists.

The following table explains the `.yaml` properties that you must set in your Kubernetes custom resource definition `.yaml` file.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `kind` | For a cluster-wide policy, specify the `kind` as `ClusterImagePolicy`. For a Kubernetes namespace policy, specify as `ImagePolicy`. |
|`//metadata/name` | Name the custom resource definition. |
| `//spec/repositories/name[@*]` | Specify the repositories to allow images from. Wildcards (`*`) are allowed in repository names. Repositories are denied unless a matching entry in `repositories` allows it or applies further verification. An empty `repositories` list blocks deployment of all images. To allow all images without verification of any policies, set the name to `*` and omit the policy subsections. |
| `//spec/repositories/name[@*]/policy` | Complete the subsections for `trust` and `va` enforcement. If you omit the policy subsections, it is equivalent to specifying `enabled: false` for each. |
| `//spec/repositories/name[@*]/policy/trust/enabled` | Set as `true` to allow only images that are [signed for content trust](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_trustedcontent) to be deployed. Set as `false` to ignore whether images are signed. |
| `//spec/repositories/name[@*]/policy/trust/signerSecrets/name` | If you want to allow only images that are signed by particular users, specify the Kubernetes secret with the signer name. Omit this field or leave it empty to verify that images are signed without enforcing particular signers. For more information, see [Specifying trusted content signers in custom policies](#specifying-trusted-content-signers-in-custom-policies). |
| `//spec/repositories/name[@*]/policy/va/enabled` | Set as `true` to allow only images that pass the [Vulnerability Advisor](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=va-va_index) scan. Set as `false` to ignore the Vulnerability Advisor scan. |

**Table 1**. Understanding the `.yaml` properties for the Kubernetes custom resource definition.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `//spec/repositories/name[@*]/policy/simple/requirements/type/insecureAcceptAnything` | This option accepts any image where signature validation isn't required. For more information, see [insecureAcceptAnything](https://github.com/containers/image/blob/main/docs/containers-policy.json.5.md#insecureacceptanything). |
| `//spec/repositories/name[@*]/policy/simple/requirements/type/reject` | This option rejects all images and signatures. For more information, see [reject](https://github.com/containers/image/blob/main/docs/containers-policy.json.5.md#reject). |
| `//spec/repositories/name[@*]/policy/simple/requirements/type/signedBy` | This option ensures that the image is signed with an expected identity and key. Valid options for this field are: `matchExact`, `matchRepoDigestOrExact`, `matchRepository`, `exactReference`, `exactRepository`, and `remapIdentity`. For more information about these options, see [signedBy](https://github.com/containers/image/blob/main/docs/containers-policy.json.5.md#signedby).|

**Table 2**. Understanding the `.yaml` components for the Kubernetes custom resource definition for `simple`.

For more information, see [Policy Requirements](https://github.com/containers/image/blob/main/docs/containers-policy.json.5.md#policy-requirements).

To customize your policies, complete the following steps:

1. Create a [Kubernetes custom resource definition](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/) `.yaml` file. For more information, see Table 1.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: portieris.cloud.ibm.com/v1
   kind: <ClusterImagePolicy_or_ImagePolicy>
   metadata:
     name: <crd_name>
   spec:
     repositories:
       - name: <repository_name>
         policy:
         trust:
             enabled: <true_or_false>
             signerSecrets:
             - name: <secret_name>
         va:
             enabled: <true_or_false>
   ```

2. Apply the `.yaml` file to your cluster.

   ```
   kubectl apply -f <filepath>
   ```
   
## Controlling who can customize policies

If role-based access control (RBAC) is enabled on your Kubernetes cluster, you can create a role to govern who can administer security policies on your cluster. For more information about applying RBAC rules to your cluster, see [Using RBAC Authorization](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/).

* In your role, add a rule for security policies:

  ```yaml
  - apiGroups: ["portieris.cloud.ibm.com"]
    resources: ["imagepolicies", "clusterimagepolicies"]
    verbs: ["get", "watch", "list", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
  ```

  **Tip** You can create multiple roles to control what actions users can take. For example, change the `verbs` so that some users can use only the `get` or `list` policies. Alternatively, you can omit `clusterimagepolicies` from the `resources` list to grant access only to Kubernetes namespace policies.

* Users who have access to delete custom resource definitions (CRDs) can delete the resource definition for security policies, which also deletes your security policies. Make sure to control who is allowed to delete CRDs. To grant access to delete CRDs, add a rule:

  ```yaml
  - apiGroups: ["apiextensions.k8s.io/v1"]
    resources: ["CustomResourceDefinition"]
    verbs: ["delete"]
  ```

  **Tip** Users and Service Accounts with the `cluster-admin` role have access to all resources. The cluster-admin role grants access to administer security policies, even if you do not edit the role. Make sure to control who has the `cluster-admin` role, and grant access only to people that you want to allow to modify security policies.
